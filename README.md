# Predicting Bike Purchase Behavior Using Logistic Regression in Python
This project explores the prediction of bike purchase behavior among customers using Logistic Regression Model.

#### Overview
This project focused on predicting bike purchase behavior using Logistic Regression. The project utilized customer data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model building.

#### Objective
To predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a bike based on thier behavior and demographics, helping businesses optimize their marketing and sales strategies.

#### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   * Cleaned and prepared data for analysis
   * Dropped unnecssary columns,encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data for consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Visualized key patterns using seaborn to understand feature relationships.
3. Modelling:
   * Built a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn.
   * Evaluated performance metrics such as Accuracy and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
4. Model Results:
   * Accuracy: 0.59
   * RMSE: 0.6403

#### Tools and Technologies
* Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

#### key Insights
* Explored features influencing purchase behaivior.
* Demonstrated the application of Logistic Regression in predictive analytics.

#### Conclusion
Leveraging Python and key libraries this project helped to identify the liklihood of a customer purchasing a bike based on various features. The model achieved an RMSE score of 0.6403, highlighting areas of improvement and further exploration.

#### Future Work
* Experiment with advanced algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
* Otimize hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
* Explore feature engineering for better predictions.
